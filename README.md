# Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository provides an overview and implementation of several popular supervised machine learning algorithms. Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so that the model can predict the label for new, unseen data.

## Algorithms Covered

1. **Linear Regression**
   - Use Case: Predicting continuous values.
   - Example: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of rooms.

2. **Logistic Regression**
   - Use Case: Binary classification.
   - Example: Predicting whether an email is spam or not spam.

3. **Decision Trees**
   - Use Case: Classification and regression.
   - Example: Classifying types of animals based on features like habitat, diet, and physical characteristics.

4. **Random Forest**
   - Use Case: Classification and regression.
   - Example: Predicting credit risk of loan applicants based on financial history and demographics.

5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
   - Use Case: Classification and regression.
   - Example: Handwritten digit recognition.

6. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
   - Use Case: Classification and regression.
   - Example: Predicting the species of a flower based on its sepal and petal measurements.

7. **Naive Bayes**
   - Use Case: Classification.
   - Example: Classifying documents into categories like sports, politics, or technology based on word frequencies.

8. **Neural Networks**
   - Use Case: Classification and regression.
   - Example: Image recognition, such as identifying objects in photos.

9. **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**
   - Use Case: Classification and regression.
   - Example: Predicting customer churn in a subscription service.

10. **Ensemble Methods**
    - Use Case: Classification and regression.
    - Example: Improving the accuracy of predictions in competitions like Kaggle.
